The water problem is huge with over 783 million not having access to clean water and over 2.1 billion lacking a sanitary facility to make clean water. Because of this, there are several people affected by disease and death around the world due to this water problem."

Although Taiwan provides a very great sanitary area in the metro region, places out of Taiwan where more distant relatives don't live in such great conditions. Because of this, they have a high chance that the water they use and consume may not be completely sanitary."
